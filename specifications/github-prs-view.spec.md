# GitHub Pull Requests View

One virtual sidebar entry per GitHub owner (user or org) that has open pull requests authored by the current `gh` user. Read-only in v1.

## Behavior

- **Only renders in the sidebar if `gh` is on PATH** (detected once at startup via a `gh --version` probe). Users without gh never see any PR entry.
- Fetch runs **once at app startup**: `gh search prs --author @me --state open --archived=false --limit 100 --json ...`. The sidebar populates with one entry per owner as soon as the response lands; before then, no PR entries appear.
- One entry per owner, sorted alphabetically. An owner with zero open PRs gets no entry — so `cxrlos` shows up alongside `appfolio`, each with its own list. Personal accounts are just another owner.
- Each sidebar row shows the owner name and an open-PR count badge for that owner.
- Mutually exclusive with Today, Upcoming, and Jira Cards.
- Archived repos are excluded (`--archived=false`) so unmergeable PRs don't linger.
- A manual refresh (`r` while the view is focused) re-runs the fetch — useful after closing a PR. No background polling otherwise.
- While the fetch is in flight the pane shows "Fetching pull requests…". If gh fails the stderr is surfaced in the pane with a "Press r to retry." hint.
- Empty state within an org's view: "No open pull requests in this org."

## Display

- PRs within an org view are grouped by repository (`owner/name` heading).
- Each row shows: status icon (● open / ◌ draft), `#number`, title, `@author`, relative update time (`3h ago`, `2d ago`).
- `j` / `k` (or arrow keys) navigate the list. Selection is visually highlighted; repo headers and blank rows are skipped.

## Actions

- **`Enter`** — open the selected PR in the default browser via `gh pr view <url> --web`. No other interactions in v1.
- **`r`** — re-run the gh fetch. Disabled while a fetch is already in progress.
- **`h`** (with cursor on a PR org row in the sidebar) — hide that organization from the sidebar. Persisted in `ui_settings.json` under `hidden_pr_orgs`. **No unhide UI in v1** — to bring an org back, edit `~/Library/Application Support/ratatoist/ui_settings.json` and remove the entry from the `hidden_pr_orgs` array.
- **`Esc`** — returns focus to the sidebar.

## Non-goals (v1)

- Reviewing, commenting, or merging from the TUI.
- Showing PRs where the user is only a reviewer or mentioned.
- Repo-scoped filtering based on ratatoist's working directory.
- Background refresh or websocket-driven updates.
- Showing checks, reviewers, or diff details inline (a future detail pane could).
